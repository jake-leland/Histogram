Histogram
=========

This program analyzes the frequency of each letter in any given document.

The user will be prompted to enter the name of a file. The file that is entered must be in the same directory as the java files.

There are three outputs:

1. The number of times each letter occurred in the document.
2. The frequency of the letters, sorted alphabetically.
3. The frequency of the letters, sorted from most frequent to least frequent.

There are two java files:
- `Histogram.java` is the Histogram class.
- `HistogramRunner.java` contains the main method. It creates a Histogram object and handles the file.
